# Keep Typing And Nobody Explodes

This program is an automated manual for the game Keep Talking Nobody Explodes.

Unlike KTANE_Voice however this is meant for the solvers' computer allowing to keep the two-person fun without the other
person needing to have an exceptional understanding of the game. May just help you on the bomb your stuck on.

* Wires
* Buttons
* Maze
* Simon Says
* Memory
* Complex Wires
* Passwords
