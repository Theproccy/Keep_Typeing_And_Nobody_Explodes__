# Keep Typing And Nobody Explodes

This program is an automated manual for the game Keep Talking Nobody Explodes.

Unlike KTANE_Voice however this is meant for the solvers' computer allowing to keep the two-person fun without the other
person needing to have an exceptional understanding of the game. May just help you on the bomb your stuck on.

## Currently, the program is capable of:

* Wires
* Buttons
* Maze
* Simon Says
* Memory
* Complex Wires
* Passwords
* Wire Sequences
* Who's on First
* Morse
* Symbols
* Knobs Solver to run in parallel

## Current Feature Being worked on:

* Looking into ways of improving the symbols module
  * Upon compilation of research new build will be uploaded


## Planed Features
* Build Script
* Refactor
* Increase support to modded modules
* Overhaul the help text(when I think of what actually will be helpful)
## Known issues:

## How to run
1. Unzip the file
2. Run the .exe
