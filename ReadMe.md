# Keep Typing And Nobody Explodes

This program is an automated manual for the game Keep Talking Nobody Explodes.

Unlike KTANE_Voice however this is meant for the solvers' computer allowing to keep the two-person fun without the other
person needing to have an exceptional understanding of the game. It may just help you on the bomb your stuck on.

## Currently, the program is capable of:

* Wires
* Buttons
* Maze
* Simon Says
* Memory
* Complex Wires
* Passwords
* Wire Sequences
* Who's on First
* Morse
* Knobs Solver to run in parallel

For Symbols, I recommend using the manual page as that is the most effective way we have discovered through testing.


## Known issues:
Whole Program Is Borked
Use Version 2
during the rewrite the program was split into multiple files. one to solve the modules and one to deal with the overall bomb (crap explination but i cant think of a better way)
the issues seam to arrive from:
a complete lack of automated testing 
the implimentation in the overall script

Soloutin is to build a test sweet for both scripts.
i have time this month so it is aiming to be compleeted at the end of december early january.




## How to run
1. Unzip the file
2. Run Keep_Typing_And_Nobody_Explodes.exe
3. Run Knobs.exe (only necessary if the bomb contains knobs)
4. Open the Bomb manual to the symbols page
5. Tah Dah
