# Keep Typing And Nobody Explodes

This program is an automated manual for the game Keep Talking Nobody Explodes.

Unlike KTANE_Voice however this is meant for the solvers' computer allowing to keep the two-person fun without the other
person needing to have an exceptional understanding of the game. It may just help you on the bomb your stuck on.

## Currently, the program is capable of:

* Wires
* Buttons
* Maze
* Simon Says
* Memory
* Complex Wires
* Passwords
* Wire Sequences
* Who's on First
* Morse
* Knobs Solver to run in parallel

For Symbols, I recommend using the manual page as that is the most effective way we have discovered through testing.


## Known issues:
As far as i am aware the program functions as intended now.  there will be more testing. 

fixes
maze when no data is enterd
simon says fix deplay text







## How to run
1. Unzip the file
2. Run Keep_Typing_And_Nobody_Explodes.exe
3. Run Knobs.exe (only necessary if the bomb contains knobs)
4. Open the Bomb manual to the symbols page
5. Tah Dah
